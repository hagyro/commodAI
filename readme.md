# Commodity Market Analysis with Anomaly Detection and Clustering (CommodAI)


**Objectives:**

1.  **Primary Goal:** Develop a Python-based (Jupyter Notebook) system for analyzing a commodity market dataset (2000-2023 closing ticks for 18 commodities) to identify and cluster periods of market instability.
2.  **Anomaly Detection:** Utilize machine learning (and potentially deep learning) techniques to detect anomalies within the time series data of each commodity.  Anomalies should be tagged with confidence levels.  Focus on identifying regions, not just individual points.
3.  **Clustering:** Perform ensemble clustering on the identified anomaly regions.  Provide statistical justification for the chosen clustering methods and the resulting clusters.  Analyze and explain the characteristics of each cluster.
4.  **Visualization:** Create a modern, interactive dashboard (within the Jupyter Notebook environment) to visualize the time series data, detected anomalies, clustering results, and statistical analyses.
5.  **Self-Contained Execution:** The entire project MUST be executable on a single machine (MacBook M1 Pro, Sonoma 14.7.3, Anaconda environment, Python 3.9.7) without relying on external web services or APIs (beyond standard package installations).
6. **Reproducibility:** The jupyter notbook must provide ALL the necessary setup for the environment to be replicated.
7. **Document:** The jupyter notebook must contain a balanced mixture of code and markdown cells to document the entire process.
