**Project Description: commodAI - Proactive Commodity Market Analysis and Early Warning System**

**1. Introduction**

Commodity markets are highly sensitive to global events, political instability, economic shifts, and environmental factors. Traditional statistical methods often struggle to capture the complex, non-linear relationships between these factors and market fluctuations.  commodAI aims to develop a proactive early warning system for commodity market instability by leveraging machine learning, specifically time series anomaly detection and ensemble clustering, combined with external data sources that capture real-world events.

**2. Project Goals**

*   **Develop a robust anomaly detection system:** Identify periods of unusual price behavior in the historical data of 18 commodities (2000-2023) using the Isolation Forest algorithm. This goes beyond simple outlier detection by identifying *regions* of anomalous behavior.
*   **Cluster anomaly regions:**  Group similar anomaly periods using ensemble clustering techniques (K-means, DBSCAN, Hierarchical Clustering). This helps to categorize different types of market shocks and understand their underlying characteristics.
*   **Incorporate external data:**  Integrate data from news articles, social media (Twitter/X), macroeconomic indicators (US GDP), and weather data to provide context and potential causal links to the identified market anomalies.
*   **Build an early warning system:**  Develop a predictive model that uses the combined market data and external data to forecast potential future periods of instability for individual commodities and across the entire market.  This model will learn from historical patterns and real-world events to provide advance warnings of potential price shocks.
*    **Interactive Dashboard:** An interactive dashboard will help visualize the commodity prices time series, the anomaly regions and allow easy comparison between the confidence assigned by the anomaly detection and allow the user to select commodities of interest.

**3. Innovation**

This project moves beyond traditional heuristic statistical methods by employing machine learning in several key areas:

*   **Unsupervised Anomaly Detection:** Isolation Forest excels at identifying unusual patterns without requiring pre-labeled data, making it suitable for discovering novel types of market disruptions.
*   **Ensemble Clustering:** Combining multiple clustering algorithms provides a more robust and nuanced understanding of anomaly types, mitigating the biases of individual algorithms.
*   **Data Fusion:**  Integrating diverse data sources (market data, news, social media, macroeconomics, weather) allows the model to learn complex relationships and potentially uncover hidden drivers of market behavior.
*   **Predictive Modeling:**  The ultimate goal is to move beyond descriptive analysis to *predictive* analysis, providing an early warning system that can anticipate future market instability.

**4. Methodology**

1.  **Data Acquisition and Preprocessing:**
    *   Commodity price data (already provided).
    *   Gather news articles (2020-2023).
    *   Collect social media posts (Twitter/X, 2020-2023).
    *   Obtain daily US GDP data (2020-2023).
    *   Acquire daily weather data (2020-2023).
    *   Clean and preprocess all data, handling missing values and ensuring consistent formatting.

2.  **Anomaly Detection and Clustering:**
    *   Apply Isolation Forest to each commodity's time series data to identify anomaly regions.
    *   Perform ensemble clustering (K-means, DBSCAN, Hierarchical) on the anomaly regions.
    *   Evaluate clustering quality using Silhouette score and Davies-Bouldin index.

3.  **Data Integration and Feature Engineering:**
    *   Combine the processed data from all sources.
    *   Engineer relevant features from the text data (news and social media), such as sentiment scores, topic keywords, and event flags.
    *   Create time-lagged features to capture the potential delayed impact of events on market prices.

4.  **Model Development and Training:**
    *   Train a machine learning model (e.g., LSTM, Transformer, or a hybrid model) to predict future anomaly probabilities based on the integrated data and engineered features.
    *   Use appropriate evaluation metrics (precision, recall, F1-score, AUC-ROC) to assess model performance.
    *   Implement cross-validation to ensure model robustness and generalization.

5.  **Early Warning System Implementation:**
    *   Develop a system that continuously monitors incoming data (market prices, news, social media) and uses the trained model to generate real-time anomaly alerts.
    *   Define thresholds for triggering alerts based on the model's output and risk tolerance.

**Data Acquisition Strategies and Resources**

Here's a breakdown of how to acquire the necessary data:

**1. News Articles (2020-2023):**

*   **Internet Archive:** The Wayback Machine is a good starting point, but scraping it programmatically can be challenging and may violate their terms of service.  It's better for targeted searches, not bulk data collection.
*   **News APIs:**
    *   **The GDELT Project:**  GDELT monitors news media worldwide and provides a powerful API for accessing historical data.  It's specifically designed for event analysis and includes features like tone and location extraction. This is likely the *best* option for this project.  You can filter by date, keywords (related to commodities, economy, politics, etc.), and location (US focus).
    *   **NewsAPI.org:**  A simpler API that provides access to news articles from various sources.  It has a free tier (with limitations) and paid plans.  You can search by keywords, date, and source.
    *   **New York Times Archive API:** If you need high-quality, in-depth reporting, the NYT API is excellent, though it's not free.
*   **Web Scraping (with caution):**  If you target specific news websites, you can use libraries like `Beautiful Soup` and `Scrapy` in Python.  *Always* check the website's `robots.txt` file and terms of service to ensure scraping is permitted.  Be respectful of server load (use delays and polite headers).

**2. Social Media Posts (Twitter/X) (2020-2023):**

*   **Twitter API (Academic Research Product Track):**  This is the *ideal* solution.  Twitter offers a dedicated API track for academic research that provides access to historical data. You'll need to apply and explain your research project.  This track provides significantly more access than the standard API.
*   **Scraping (very limited and not recommended):**  Twitter heavily restricts scraping.  While tools exist, they are unreliable and likely to violate Twitter's terms of service.  The API is the only truly viable long-term solution.
*   **Alternative Social Media Data:** Consider if other platforms (Reddit, financial forums) might have relevant discussions, but be aware of data quality and bias issues.

**3. US GDP Data (Daily, 2020-2023):**

*   **Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED):** FRED, provided by the St. Louis Fed, is the gold standard for US macroeconomic data. They have daily data.
*   **Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA):** The BEA is the official source for US GDP data.  They release data quarterly, but you might find daily interpolations or related indicators on FRED.
*    **Trading Economics** Provides daily values for a great range of indicators, such as GDP.

**4. Weather Data (Daily, 2020-2023):**

*   **National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA):** NOAA's Climate Data Online (CDO) provides access to historical weather data from various stations across the US.  You can use their API to retrieve daily data for specific locations or regions.  They have several APIs, including a dedicated "Daily Summaries" API.
*   **OpenWeatherMap API:**  Provides a free tier (with limitations) for accessing historical weather data.  It's easy to use and well-documented.
*   **Visual Crossing API:** Provides a free tier to retrieve historical weather data.

**Python Libraries for Data Acquisition:**

*   **`requests`:**  For making HTTP requests to APIs.
*   **`json`:**  For handling JSON data returned by APIs.
*   **`Beautiful Soup`:**  For parsing HTML and XML (for web scraping).
*   **`Scrapy`:**  A more powerful framework for building web scrapers.
*   **`tweepy`:**  A Python library for accessing the Twitter API.
*   **`pandas`:**  For data manipulation and analysis.
*   **`gdeltpy`:**  A Python library specifically for interacting with the GDELT API.

Project: commodAI - Commodity Market Early Warning System

Context:

We are developing a system to analyze commodity market data and predict periods of instability. We have already implemented anomaly detection (Isolation Forest) and ensemble clustering (K-means, DBSCAN, Hierarchical) on historical commodity price data (2000-2023).  The current notebook (provided) loads the data, performs anomaly detection and clustering, and visualizes the results.

Next Steps:

We need to integrate external data sources to provide context and potentially causal links to the detected market anomalies.  These sources include:

1.  News Articles (2020-2023): Focus on articles related to society, wars, political events, market sentiment, and specific commodities.
2.  Social Media Posts (Twitter/X, 2020-2023):  Similar focus as news articles, capturing public sentiment and discussions.
3.  US GDP Data (Daily, 2020-2023):  Daily observations of US GDP.
4.  Weather Data (Daily, 2020-2023):  Daily weather data for the US.

Task:

Create Python code (to be integrated into the existing Jupyter Notebook) to perform the following:

1.  Data Acquisition:
    *   Implement functions to retrieve data from the following APIs:
        *   GDELT Project API (for news articles). Prioritize GDELT.
        *   Twitter API (Academic Research Product Track - assume we have access).
        *   FRED API (for US GDP data).
        *   NOAA Daily Summaries API (for weather data).
    *   If API access is straightforward, implement the data retrieval directly. If complex authentication or data processing is required, provide clear instructions and code skeletons.
    *  Handle potential API errors gracefully (e.g., rate limits, connection issues).
    *   Store the retrieved data in pandas DataFrames with appropriate column names and data types.  Ensure dates are handled correctly.

2.  Data Preprocessing:
    *   Clean and preprocess the text data (news articles and tweets):
        *   Remove irrelevant characters, punctuation, and HTML tags.
        *   Convert text to lowercase.
        *   Consider stemming or lemmatization.
        *   Handle missing values appropriately.
    *   Preprocess the GDP and weather data:
        *   Ensure consistent date formats.
        *   Handle missing values (e.g., using interpolation or forward/backward fill).

3. Integration with Existing Notebook:
    * Show how to best integrate these new functions in the jupyter notebook.
    * Add markdown cells to properly explain the newly added code.
    * Suggest next steps in the development.

Example Function Signature (for GDELT):

```python
import pandas as pd
from datetime import date

def get_gdelt_data(start_date: date, end_date: date, keywords: list) -> pd.DataFrame:
    """
    Retrieves news article data from the GDELT API for a specified date range and keywords.

    Args:
        start_date: The start date (inclusive).
        end_date: The end date (inclusive).
        keywords: A list of keywords to filter the articles.

    Returns:
        A pandas DataFrame containing the retrieved news article data, or None if an error occurred.
    """
    # ... implementation details ...
```

Deliverables:

*   Well-documented Python code for data acquisition and preprocessing.
*   Clear instructions for integrating the code into the existing Jupyter Notebook.
*   Example usage of the functions.
*   Suggestions for error handling and API rate limiting.

```
